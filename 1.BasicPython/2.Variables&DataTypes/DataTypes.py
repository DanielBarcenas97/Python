'''
Datatypes. In Python, every value has a datatype, but you don't need
to declare the datatype of variables.How does that Work?
Based on each variableâ€™s original assignment, Python figures out 
what type it is and keeps tracks of that internally. 
'''
type(2)       #This is a integer
type(2.2)     #This is a float
type(True)    #This is a Boolean
type('a')     #This is a string
type('Hello') #This is a string

''' 
Python has many native datatypes.Here are the important ones:
1.Booleans: Are eithar True or False
2.Number:   Can be integers(1,2,10,etc), float(1.1,3.1416,etc), Franctions (1/2, 2/3 etc)
3.Strings:  Are sequences of Unicode characters. Are either "a", "Hello", "Bye"
4.Lists:    Are ordenerd sequences of values
5.Tuples:   Are ordenerd, inmutable sequences of values.
6.Sets:     Are unordered bags of values
7.Bytes and Bytes Arrays: Example JPEG image file.    
8.Dictionaries: Are unordered bags of keys-value pairs.
